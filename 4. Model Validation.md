# **Model Validation**

## **Introduction**
You've built a model. But how good is it?

In this lesson, you will learn to use model validation to measure the quality of your model. Measuring model quality is the key to iteratively improving your models.

## **What is Model Validation**
You'll want to evaluate almost every model you ever build. In most (though not all) applications, the relevant measure of model quality is predictive accuracy. In other words, will the model's predictions be close to what actually happens.

Many people make a huge mistake when measuring predictive accuracy. They make predictions with their training data and compare those predictions to the target values in the training data. You'll see the problem with this approach and how to solve it in a moment, but let's think about how we'd do this first.

You'd first need to summarize the model quality into an understandable way. If you compare predicted and actual home values for 10,000 houses, you'll likely find mix of good and bad predictions. Looking through a list of 10,000 predicted and actual values would be pointless. We need to summarize this into a single metric.

## **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
There are many metrics for summarizing model quality, but we'll start with one called Mean Absolute Error (also called MAE). Let's break down this metric starting with the last word, error.

The prediction error for each house is:

**error = actual − predicted**

So, if a house cost $150,000 and you predicted it would cost $100,000 the error is $50,000.

With the MAE metric, we take the absolute value of each error. This converts each error to a positive number. We then take the average of those absolute errors. This is our measure of model quality. In plain English, it can be said as:

**On average, our predictions are off by about X.**

To calculate MAE, we first need a model. Once we have a model, here is how we calculate the mean absolute error:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

predicted_home_prices = melbourne_model.predict(X)
mean_absolute_error(y, predicted_home_prices)
```

Output:
```
434.71594577146544
```

This seems like a great result! Our predictions are only off by about $435 on average. But there's a big problem...

## **The Problem with "In-Sample" Scores**
The measure we just computed can be called an "in-sample" score. We used a single "sample" of houses for both building the model and evaluating it. Here's why this is bad.

Imagine that, in the large real estate market, door color is unrelated to home price.

However, in the sample of data you used to build the model, all homes with green doors were very expensive. The model's job is to find patterns that predict home prices, so it will see this pattern, and it will always predict high prices for homes with green doors.

Since this pattern was derived from the training data, the model will appear accurate in the training data.

But if this pattern doesn't hold when the model sees new data, the model would be very inaccurate when used in practice.

Since models' practical value come from making predictions on new data, we measure performance on data that wasn't used to build the model. The most straightforward way to do this is to exclude some data from the model-building process, and then use those to test the model's accuracy on data it hasn't seen before. This data is called validation data.



## **Train-Test Split: Coding It**
The scikit-learn library has a function `train_test_split` to break up the data into two pieces. We'll use some of that data as training data to fit the model, and we'll use the other data as validation data to calculate mean_absolute_error.

Here is the code:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# split data into training and validation data, for both features and target
# The split is based on a random number generator. Supplying a numeric value to
# the random_state argument guarantees we get the same split every time we
# run this script.
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state = 0)
# Define model
melbourne_model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
# Fit model
melbourne_model.fit(train_X, train_y)

# get predicted prices on validation data
val_predictions = melbourne_model.predict(val_X)
print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, val_predictions))
```

Output:
```
265806.91478373145
```

**Wow!** Your mean absolute error for the in-sample data was about 500 dollars. Out-of-sample it is more than 250,000 dollars.

This is the difference between a model that is almost exactly right, and one that is unusable for most practical purposes. As a point of reference, the average home value in the validation data is 1.1 million dollars. So the error in new data is about a quarter of the average home value.

## **Common Validation Strategies**

### **1. Train-Test Split**
We just saw this approach. It's simple and effective, but it has limitations:
- It provides a single estimate of model performance
- With small datasets, the validation score can vary significantly depending on which data points end up in the validation set

```python
# Simple train-test split (typically 70-80% train, 20-30% test)
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.8, random_state=0)
```

### **2. K-Fold Cross-Validation**
To get a more robust measure of model quality, we can use k-fold cross-validation:
1. Divide data into k parts (usually 5 or 10)
2. For each part:
   - Use that part as validation data
   - Use the remaining data as training data
   - Calculate validation score
3. Average the validation scores

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Example with 5 folds
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')
average_mae = -scores.mean()
```

### **3. Time-Based Validation**
For time series data (like stock prices or weather), we typically want to validate on the most recent data:

```python
# Assuming data is sorted by date
train_size = int(len(X) * 0.8)
train_X, val_X = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]
train_y, val_y = y[:train_size], y[train_size:]
```

## **Validation Metrics**
So far, we've focused on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), but there are many metrics to consider:

### **Regression Metrics**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared difference (penalizes large errors more)
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE (more interpretable, same units as target)
- **R² (R-squared)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model (1 is perfect, 0 is baseline)

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score

mae = mean_absolute_error(val_y, predictions)
mse = mean_squared_error(val_y, predictions)
rmse = mean_squared_error(val_y, predictions, squared=False)  # Set squared=False for RMSE
r2 = r2_score(val_y, predictions)
```

### **Classification Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
